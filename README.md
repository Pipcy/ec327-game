Follow [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GzOz6lCIO9-j1esVCNZ64J18vl1_PMV1DgRqveJSo84/edit?usp=sharing) for a detailed cloning/downloading instructions!

## !Attention for Testers!

1. After cloning the project, please select ****Pixel 2 + upsideDownCake + landscape**** as your emulator setting! (detailed instructions above)
2. The game has great audio, so ****turning audio on**** is recommended, 
Wifi connection is required for the online leaderboard to work properly. All other parts do not. If you go to the leaderboard and nothing shows up, try going back and clicking sync data.
3. When you play the game for the first time, you receive a ****unique ID**** number that is binded to that device. You can change your username but the score would be updated to the same ID.
4. If you get sent back to the beginning of a game after finishing it - ****it is a glitch that we are experiencing****. Simply continue to the game and exit by hitting the pause button and “return to main menu.”

## Summary
### Category
Animated Game

### TL;DR
Our game simulates different aspects of memorable moments from EC327, with an added twist of course!

### Description
Dive into the world of EC327 and get a taste of what it's like. Customize your character and explore the classroom. You'll be given a chance to demonstrate your machine code skills and test your knowledge of your fellow classmates and peers. Be careful when answering machine code questions as getting a question wrong might incur the wrath of Professor Trachtenberg. Compete with other players for a place in the leaderboard.

## Execution

### Project source
[Links to all code needed to compile and run your project _from scratch_ .  If you are using some libraries, provide links to their code.]

### Installation
[Clear, terse instructions on how to compile and run your app on lab machines.  Try this out on non-members, friends, etc.]

### Usage
[Clear, terse instructions on how to use your app.  What do the different interface elements (buttons, menus, etc.) do?  How does one see the various requirements and features in action.]

---
## Miscellaneous

### Extra features
[Any extra features provided by your app that were not mentioned in the minimum requirements or possible features.  Did you put your app on the Google App store?  Did you implement a half-baked idea that was not envisioned at the start of the project?]

### Challenges
[Where there any specific challenges during the implementation of this project that deserve note.  Feel free to include ideas that you tried but failed to work, in terse fashion.]

### Supporting material
[Any videos, slides, etc. that could help someone understand your project.]

### Release
[Are you comfortable with having this project visible to the broader public?  This would allow you, for example, to put it on a resume or showcase to potential employers.  _All_ group members must agree to making the project public, or else it will remain private.]
